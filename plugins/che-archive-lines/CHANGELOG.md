## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-06

Plugin-shell upgrade to the current `harness-devtools:plugin-upgrade` baseline and the official plugin reference ([#139](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/139), parent PsychQuant/che-msg#39). `scripts/line-save-chat.sh` changes only to validate config values ([#149](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/149)).

### Changed
- **Behavior change:** `commands/archive-lines.md` is now `skills/archive-lines/SKILL.md`, invoked as `/che-archive-lines:archive-lines`. It sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so Claude no longer starts this GUI automation on its own; scheduled tasks whose prompt is this skill, and subagent skill preloads, no longer run it either.
- **Behavior change:** `calibrate` is no longer run by Claude. Calibration waits for the user to press Enter in a terminal, and the Bash tool has none: running it there exits at that prompt, and piping two or more lines in would record wherever the mouse happens to be, overwriting a good calibration (an empty second line stores the default menu offset, 240) ([#145](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/145)). The skill now shows the full command for the user to run in their own terminal. Because the script first brings LINE to the front, keystrokes then go to LINE — pressing Enter there can send a draft — so the README and the skill say to switch back to the terminal with Cmd-Tab before pressing Enter.
- The skill only ever passes one of the four literal verbs (`calibrate`, `save`, `test`, `help`) to the script; any other argument is answered with the list of verbs, and an empty one means `help`.

### Fixed
- The script path is now `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/line-save-chat.sh`, which Claude Code substitutes with the installed plugin location. Before, the command derived it with `$(dirname "$(dirname "$0")")`, but in command and skill content `$0` is the first argument (`save`, `test`, …), so this resolved to `.`, the user's working directory. It also listed a fixed install location under `~/.claude/plugins/` (marketplace installs live in the plugin cache instead) and ran `./scripts/line-save-chat.sh` relative to the user's project directory.
- The bare `/archive-lines` now works while no other command uses the name: the skill sets `name: archive-lines`, and a plugin skill gets its bare alias only from that field. In 1.0.0 only the namespaced form worked, although the repository's CLAUDE.md documented the bare one.
- README install instructions use the marketplace name (`che-archive-lines@psychquant-claude-plugins`) and no longer describe copying the plugin into `~/.claude/plugins/`.

### Security
- `allowed-tools` narrowed from `Bash(*), Read, Write, Glob` to three exact rules: `Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/line-save-chat.sh save)`, `… test)` and `… help)`. Before, any shell command and any file write ran without a prompt in the turn the command was invoked. Now only those three commands do, in the turn the skill is invoked, unless the user's own deny or ask rules or managed settings say otherwise; `calibrate`, any other argument and any other command go through the user's normal permission settings. The grant clears when the user sends the next message. `Read`, `Write` and `Glob` are no longer pre-approved.
- Exact rules rather than a trailing `*`: Claude Code matches a rule against each subcommand of a pipeline or chain, and read-only commands such as `printf` need no approval, so `Bash(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/line-save-chat.sh *)` would also pre-approve `calibrate`, including `printf '\n\n' | … calibrate`. A grant cannot be tied to the verb the user typed: in the invoking turn all three commands run unprompted whichever verb was given, and after that turn the script goes through the user's normal permission settings again (in auto mode the classifier decides).
- Checked with `claude -p --plugin-dir` probes on Claude Code 2.1.291 (`--permission-mode default --setting-sources project`, execution detected by marker files written by a stand-in script, with this skill's `allowed-tools` block copied verbatim): `"…" help` ran; `"…" calibrate`, `printf '\n\n' | "…" calibrate`, `"…" save; touch …` and `"…" calibrate2` were denied and nothing ran. `printf 'x\n' | "…" save` ran — piped input does reach the script — but only `calibrate` reads stdin, and it is not pre-approved.
- `scripts/line-save-chat.sh` now accepts only integers for the three config values before they reach shell arithmetic ([#149](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/149)). bash evaluates array subscripts inside `$((…))`, so a value such as `a[$(command)]` in `~/.config/che-archive-lines/config.json` ran that command on every `save` or `test`, including the pre-approved ones. `load_config` now rejects any value that is not an integer of at most six digits without a leading zero (bash reads `010` as octal), and defaults a missing `menu_offset_y` to 240; `save_config` refuses to write such a value, and `calibrate` rejects a typed menu offset that is not one. The earlier grep (`[^,}]*` plus `tr -d ' '`) was not a defence: it only cut off payloads that contained a space, a comma or a `}`. Covered by `tests/che-archive-lines/test-config-validation.sh`, which runs the script against stub `cliclick` and `osascript` commands and a scratch `HOME`.

### Removed
- A hard-coded absolute path to one machine's cloud-sync folder in the command file (this repository is public).

### Docs
- README notes that LINE's local message database (`.edb`) is encrypted; the readable source is the "Save chat" `.txt` export. A LINE MCP that reads those exports is tracked in PsychQuant/che-msg#41.
