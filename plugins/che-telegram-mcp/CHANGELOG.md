## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.1] - 2026-10-06

Documentation corrections found while verifying [#139](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/139), which shares this plugin's skill layout ([#138](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/138)). No change to the skills, wrappers or binaries; the wrappers still pin `DESIRED_VERSION` 0.5.0.

### Fixed
- The 1.4.0 README and Security note said that "in the default permission mode Claude Code asks before sending" with `send`. Since Claude Code v2.1.283, interactive terminal and VS Code sessions start in auto mode, where a classifier reviews the call and, unless an ask rule matches, nothing is asked, so most readers would have drawn the opposite conclusion. The README now names the modes as Claude Code does — Manual (config value `default`) and `acceptEdits` ask unless an allow rule matches; auto lets the classifier decide, and a matching allow rule skips the classifier; `bypassPermissions` does not ask; `dontAsk` refuses the call unless an allow rule matches — and recommends an ask rule for the personal-account `send_message` (what `send` uses) as the one setting that makes it ask in any mode (in `dontAsk`, an ask rule refuses instead), listing the other sending tools that need ask rules of their own.

### Tests
- `tests/che-telegram-mcp/test-plugin-layout.sh` (marketplace repo) now reads skill frontmatter the way Claude Code does. It finds the boundary as Claude Code does — the first `---` after the opening line, even inside a value, using JavaScript's whitespace class and no newline translation — and it requires the block to stay inside plain YAML that PyYAML (YAML 1.1, used by the test) and Bun.YAML (YAML 1.2, used by Claude Code) read alike: no control or line-separator characters such as NEL or U+2028, and no anchors, aliases, tags, block scalars, flow collections, merge or explicit keys. Outside that subset the two parsers disagree, and Claude Code could drop `disable-model-invocation` while the test passed.
- Check (h) accepts only the unquoted literal `true` for the four slash skills, since Claude Code before 2.1.218 recognises nothing else; check (g) accepts only an absent key or the literal `false` on the router, in both the typed and the string view, since Claude Code also reads yes/on/1 and numbers such as `1.0` as true. New check (i): no skill registers `hooks` (they outlast the turn's grant) or has a `` !`command` `` / ```` ```! ```` block (it runs when the skill is invoked, before Claude reads it).
- Mutation cases 31 → 49; the 1.4.0 test misses 13 of the 17 new failure cases.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-10-06

Plugin-shell upgrade to the current `harness-devtools:plugin-upgrade` baseline and the official plugin reference ([#138](https://github.com/PsychQuant/psychquant-claude-plugins/issues/138), parent PsychQuant/che-msg#39). No binary change — the wrappers still pin `DESIRED_VERSION` 0.5.0.

### Changed
- **Behavior change:** `commands/{auth,chats,search,send}.md` are now skills (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), invoked as `/che-telegram-mcp:<name>` (the bare `/auth` still works while no other command uses the name). They set `disable-model-invocation: true`, so Claude no longer invokes them on its own — up to 1.3.2 these were commands that Claude could also load by itself. The same setting also stops scheduled tasks whose prompt is one of these skills, and subagent skill preloads, from running them. Natural-language requests go through `telegram-messaging`, which stays model-invocable.
- The wrapper tests (`test-wrapper-mcp-error.sh`, `test-wrapper-pid.sh`) moved out of the shipped plugin to `tests/che-telegram-mcp/` in the marketplace repo, so only the two wrappers remain in `bin/` and on the Bash tool's `PATH`.
- The wrappers themselves stay in `bin/`, because the harness-devtools release tooling finds them only there: `plugin-binary-meta.sh` (used by `plugin-update`) scans `bin/` and `hooks/`, and `plugin-deploy`'s release gate globs `bin/*wrapper.sh`. A move to `scripts/` was tried while preparing this release and reverted, because it made the `DESIRED_VERSION` pin detection and that gate silently stop working. A consequence is that the plugin still has `bin/`, so claude.ai and Cowork will not install it — which does not cost anything here, since both servers need a local TDLib binary and Keychain.
- `plugin.json` description now states the real tool counts (telegram-all 28, telegram-bot 31) instead of "28+".

### Fixed
- `allowed-tools` in the four entry points named `mcp__che-telegram-mcp__*`, which matches no tool, so the pre-approval never applied. They now use `mcp__plugin_che-telegram-mcp_telegram-all__*`.
- SessionStart hook command quotes `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the only `claude plugin validate` warning).

### Security
- **Net effect is a widening for `auth`, `chats` and `search`:** before, nothing was pre-approved (the names were wrong); now each skill pre-approves the tools it lists, but only for the turn in which it is invoked — the grant clears when the user sends the next message. For `auth` the list includes the credential-entry tools `auth_set_parameters`, `auth_send_phone`, `auth_send_code` and `auth_send_password`; in practice the later steps happen after the user has replied with a phone number or code, so they usually go through the normal permission settings anyway. The marketplace-repo test `tests/che-telegram-mcp/test-plugin-layout.sh` keeps this list on an explicit read-only allowlist (login steps only in `auth`).
- `send` deliberately does not pre-approve `send_message`, because a sent message cannot be recalled. That leaves `send_message` under the user's normal permission settings: in the default permission mode Claude Code asks before sending; in `bypassPermissions` or auto mode, or with an allow rule for the tool, it does not, and the skill's instruction to confirm the recipient and text first is the only remaining guard.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- `che-telegram-all-mcp-wrapper.sh`: lock-refused branch now emits a JSON-RPC 2.0 error envelope to stdout before exiting, so Claude Code's MCP client parses the human-readable message + structured data instead of seeing only `-32000 Server error`. Envelope carries:
  - `error.code: -32000` (JSON-RPC server-defined errors range)
  - `error.message: "Another instance of CheTelegramAllMCP is already running (lock held by PID NNNN). Use the existing Claude Code window, or kill the previous wrapper first."`
  - `error.data.lockHolderPid: <pid>` (machine-readable lock holder)
  - `error.data.recoveryCommand: "pkill CheTelegramAllMCP 2>/dev/null; rm -rf ~/.cache/che-telegram-all-mcp.lock ~/.cache/che-telegram-all-mcp.lock.flock"` (semicolon, not `&&`, so cleanup runs even when no process exists)
  - `error.data.docsUrl: https://.../README.md#multi-session-limitation`

  The original stderr message is retained for direct-shell debug.

  **PR-1b id matching (added 2026-05-22 after empirical verification)**: wrapper reads the first line of stdin (with 2s timeout) to extract the JSON-RPC `initialize` request's `id` field, then emits the response envelope with **matching id**. This was required because empirical two-session reproduction in Claude Code v2.1.148 showed that `id: null` responses (the v1.3.2 first attempt) are not matched to pending `initialize` requests and don't surface in Claude Code's MCP error state. With matching-id (PR-1b), debug-log capture confirmed Claude Code's MCP client correctly parses the envelope + stores the full `error.message` internally.

  Stdin extraction uses `jq` when available (preferred) and a bash regex fallback for environments without jq. Handles MCP 1.0 spec id forms: integer, quoted string, or null.

  New `test-wrapper-mcp-error.sh` covers 6 cases: happy path / lock refused emits valid JSON / stale-lock self-recovery / recoveryCommand validation / id-matching with initialize request / timeout fallback to null. Resolves [#31](https://github.com/PsychQuant/che-msg/issues/31).

  **Known UX gap** (out of plugin scope): Claude Code's `/mcp` short-list UI may display only `-32000` (truncated form) instead of the full message. The full message IS captured in Claude Code's internal MCP error state (verified via `--debug mcp` debug logs) and is available to downstream tool consumers. The display truncation is a Claude Code UI policy concern, not a plugin issue.

### Documentation
- `README.md`: added `## Multi-session limitation` section explaining the TDLib single-instance constraint, the v1.3.2+ human-readable error message, and a recovery cookbook (`pkill CheTelegramAllMCP 2>/dev/null; rm -rf ~/.cache/che-telegram-all-mcp.lock ~/.cache/che-telegram-all-mcp.lock.flock`). Documents the pre-v1.3.2 generic `-32000` symptom for users upgrading.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- `che-telegram-all-mcp-wrapper.sh`: add atomic-claim lock (flock with mkdir fallback) before PID-tracking section. Prevents the multi-window race where window B reads window A's PID, sees an alive `CheTelegramAllMCP` process, sends SIGTERM and unannouncedly kills window A's MCP server. Lock is portable: uses `flock -n` when available (Linux / macOS Sequoia+ if shipped), falls back to atomic `mkdir` directory-claim on systems without flock (verified macOS 26.4.1). Stale-lock cleanup removes orphaned locks whose owner PID is dead. Failure mode is now fail-fast with clear stderr message instead of silent SIGTERM cross-fire. `che-telegram-bot-mcp-wrapper.sh` deliberately unchanged — bot HTTPS API is stateless, multi-instance safe. New regression test (`test-wrapper-pid.sh` test 9) verifies second instance fail-fast + first instance survival. Resolves #10.

## [1.3.0] - (date unknown — please fill in)
