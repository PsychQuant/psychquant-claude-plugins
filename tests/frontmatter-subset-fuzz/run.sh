# Fuzz evidence for tests/lib/frontmatter_subset.py (#139 verify round 4).
#
# Generates random frontmatter blocks heavy in the cases where PyYAML and
# Claude Code's Bun.YAML disagree (open quotes, `: `, `#`, `---`, `...`, NEL,
# U+2028, list indentation, CRLF), keeps the blocks subset_problems() accepts,
# and compares PyYAML with Bun.YAML.parse. Fails if Bun's first parse fails on
# an accepted block (Claude Code would then rewrite and re-parse it), or if the
# two disagree on structure or on a string value. Scalar type differences
# (yes/on/1e0) are counted, not failed: the layout tests compare the values
# they care about as exact strings.
#
# Requires bun (https://bun.sh) and PyYAML. Not part of the layout tests.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/frontmatter-subset-fuzz/run.sh [blocks-per-seed] [seed ...]
#   bash tests/frontmatter-subset-fuzz/run.sh 50000 13 29
